# üîê Enhanced Communication Security: Leveraging Quantum Cryptography (BB84 Protocol)

Welcome to the **Enhanced Communication Security** project! This system leverages the **BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol** to establish a secure communication channel between two parties, Alice and Bob. Using quantum cryptography and modern encryption techniques, Alice and Bob generate a shared secret key to ensure highly secure message and file transfers.

## üìú Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end secure communication system** that combines **quantum key distribution** and **AES encryption**. Alice and Bob:
1. Use the **BB84 Protocol** to generate and agree upon a secret key.
2. Authenticate and validate messages using **MAC IDs**.
3. Encrypt messages and files using **AES-128 encryption** with CBC mode.

**Note**: This README assumes you are familiar with fundamental cryptographic concepts and Python programming.

## üõ† Project Structure
The main components are split into several Python files for modularity and clarity:

- `Alice_bb84.py`: Contains code for Alice's implementation of the BB84 protocol and key generation.
- `Bob_bb84.py`: Contains code for Bob‚Äôs side of the BB84 protocol, including response handling.
- `alice_communication.py`: Alice‚Äôs side of the secure communication, focusing on message encryption, MAC generation, and timestamp management.
- `bob_communication.py`: Bob's secure message viewer, message decryption, and file saving functionality. Bob also verifies MAC IDs and timestamps.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **Python** (>=3.8) with `cryptography` and `tkinter` libraries.
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install cryptography
     ```

### Files to Prepare
- **final_key.txt**: Ensure you have the secret key file (generated by the BB84 protocol) saved as `final_key.txt` in the same directory. This file should contain a 16-byte secret key.

### Usage
1. **Alice's Communication**
   - Run `alice_communication.py` to start Alice‚Äôs secure message sender.
2. **Bob's Communication**
   - Run `bob_communication.py` to start Bob‚Äôs secure message receiver GUI, enabling decryption and verification.

### Run the Project
```bash
python Alice_bb84.py  # To start Alice's BB84 key generation
python Bob_bb84.py     # To start Bob's BB84 key generation
python alice_communication.py  # For Alice to send encrypted messages/files
python bob_communication.py    # For Bob to receive messages/files
```

## üìù Detailed Features

### 1. BB84 Protocol Key Generation
The **BB84 Protocol** allows Alice and Bob to generate a shared secret key over a quantum channel. This key is then used to secure communication between Alice and Bob via AES encryption and HMAC authentication.

### 2. Secure Message Transmission
- **MAC ID Generation**: Each message is authenticated using a **Message Authentication Code (MAC)**, generated via HMAC-SHA256, to ensure integrity and authenticity.
- **AES-128 Encryption**: Messages and files are encrypted with **AES-128** in **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode** to maintain confidentiality.
- **Timestamp Validation**: Each message is timestamped. Upon receiving, Bob verifies the message‚Äôs timestamp to ensure it falls within a 30-second time window, preventing replay attacks.

### 3. GUI for Message Log (Bob's Side)
Bob‚Äôs side features a user-friendly GUI with a **message log** for reviewing received messages. It highlights:
   - Validated MAC IDs, showing messages that have passed integrity checks.
   - Timestamp validation feedback, flagging messages outside the secure time window.
   
### 4. File Decryption and Saving
Bob‚Äôs GUI also supports **file decryption and saving**. Received encrypted files are decrypted and saved to the **Documents** folder on Bob's machine, providing a secure and organized way to handle transferred files.

## üí° Future Improvements
1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Expand MAC and timestamp validation with more robust error-checking mechanisms.
2. **Integration with Quantum Simulators**: Connect the BB84 protocol to a quantum simulator like **Qiskit** for real-time quantum key distribution.
3. **Improve GUI**: Make the interface more intuitive and visually appealing, enhancing user experience.
